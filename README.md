## Description

#### This project is my independent project (IP) for java spark week 2

Hero Squad is a project that allows users who interact with it to create heroes and squads/alliances that contain a particular number of heroes. Heroes can be affiliated with only 1 squad at a single time, therefore if the hero was to switch to another group, their name should not be present in the previous squad that they were in

A Hero Squad game is an interactive game where players have the opportunity to recruit and assemble a team of superheroes to combat various challenges and enemies. The game revolves around the concept of creating a well-balanced team of superheroes, each with unique abilities and weaknesses, to overcome obstacles and accomplish missions.

In a Hero Squad game, players typically have the following objectives and gameplay elements:

Recruit Heroes: Players have the ability to select and recruit different heroes into their squad. Each hero possesses their own special powers, skills, and weaknesses. The players must strategically choose heroes with complementary abilities to form a strong and balanced team.

Squad Formation: Players need to strategically assign heroes to their squad, considering factors such as team synergy, tactical advantages, and mission requirements. The squad formation plays a crucial role in determining the overall effectiveness and success of the team.

Missions and Challenges: The game presents various missions, quests, or challenges that the Hero Squad must undertake. These missions can range from rescuing hostages, defeating supervillains, solving puzzles, or protecting the city from imminent threats. Players must navigate through different levels, face adversaries, and utilize their heroes' unique abilities to overcome obstacles and achieve the mission objectives.

Turn-Based Battles: Hero Squad games often incorporate turn-based combat mechanics. Players engage in battles with enemies or other opposing forces, taking turns to execute actions and abilities. The outcome of battles depends on factors such as hero abilities, strategy, and tactical decision-making.

Overall, Hero Squad games provide an immersive and engaging experience, allowing players to immerse themselves in a world of superheroes, teamwork, and strategic decision-making. The game combines elements of role-playing, strategy, and action to create an exciting and dynamic gameplay experience.

## Prerequisites

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To run the Hero Squad game on your local machine, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have a valid JDK installed and configured properly in your development environment. The Hero Squad game is built using Java, so having a compatible JDK is essential.

IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE of your choice): You will need an integrated development environment to open and work with the Hero Squad game code. IntelliJ IDEA is recommended, but you can use any Java IDE that supports Gradle projects.

Git: Git is a version control system that allows you to clone and manage the project's source code repository. Make sure Git is installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from the official website (https://git-scm.com/).

Once you have the necessary prerequisites installed, follow these steps to set up and run the Hero Squad game:

Clone the repository: Open your terminal or Git bash and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command:

Go to git bash and Copy code:
git clone (https://github.com/jkwaweru/hero-squad.git)
This will create a local copy of the project on your machine.

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA: Launch IntelliJ IDEA and select "Open" from the File menu. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project and select it. IntelliJ IDEA will load the project.

Build the project: Once the project is open in IntelliJ IDEA, it will automatically detect the Gradle configuration and build the project. Wait for the build process to complete.

Run the application: In the IntelliJ IDEA toolbar, locate the "Run" button and click on it. Select the main application class and click the "Run" button again. This will run the Hero Squad game on a local server.

Access the application: Open your web browser and enter the following URL: http://localhost:4567. The Hero Squad game should now be accessible, and you can interact with it through the browser.

That's it! You have successfully set up and installed the Hero Squad game on your local machine. You can now start recruiting heroes, forming squads, and playing the game.
